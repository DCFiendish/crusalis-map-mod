# Crusalis Map Mod

A Fabric client mod that adds a live nation/territory overlay to Xaero's
Minimap and World Map, built for the [Nodes](https://nodes.soy/) town/nation
plugin. It polls the server's public map-data endpoints and Minecraft chat to
keep the overlay in sync in near real time — nation-colored territory fills,
resource node borders/labels, town and nation name labels, port markers, and
live war visuals during a siege.

## Features

- **Nation territory fills** — every claimed territory tinted by its owning
  nation's color, with the home/core chunk of each territory marked distinctly.
- **Resource node borders & labels** — territory outlines and resource-type
  labels (diamonds, gold, iron, etc.) for nodes with resources.
- **Town & nation labels** — town names at their spawn point; nation names at
  each nation's capital.
- **Ports** — port markers.
- **War visuals**, driven live off in-game `[War]` chat messages:
  - *Occupied territories* — a diagonal marker across a captured-but-not-yet-annexed
    territory, in the occupier's color, while the base fill still shows the
    original owner.
  - *Per-chunk war stripes* — a temporary highlight + X-mark on chunks captured
    within the last 90 seconds.
  - *Under-attack stripes* — a diagonal on chunks with a flag currently planted.
- All of the above are individually toggleable and opacity/width-adjustable via
  [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) / [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).

## Requirements

- Fabric Loader, Fabric API
- Minecraft 1.21.11
- [XaeroPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeroplus) 2.29.2 or newer (any 1.21.11 release,
  2.29.2 through 2.36.4 checked)
- [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and
  [Xaero's World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map): whichever versions
  your XaeroPlus release asks for. Each XaeroPlus release pins its own World Map
  version, so across the 1.21.11 line that is Minimap 25.3.1 to 26.5.0 and World Map
  1.40.1 to 1.46.0.
- Cloth Config, Mod Menu
